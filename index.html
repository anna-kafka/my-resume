    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a graduate of Management at the University of Gdańsk. During my
      studies, I acquired knowledge in the field of marketing and project
      management. I also took part in an 8-week Google training program "Skills
      of Tomorrow" in the field of internet marketing. It opened the door for me
      to take part in a 3-month internship as an Internet Marketing Specialist
      in one of the companies. There I could use my knowledge and skills that I
      learned during the course. I am still learning and improving in digital
      marketing. Currently looking for an internship or job in the field of
      social media, performance marketing and marketing communication.
